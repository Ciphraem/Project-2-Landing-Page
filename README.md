# Project-2-Landing-Page
This is the second project from TOP, after the lessons in CSS.

Note: Not responsive yet. Please don't expect. Thanks!

Here, I'll be making a webpage and style sheet from scratch. Definitely a great way to integrate what I've learned so far into one. Doing this feels like I'm following a design made by someone from scratchh, which is something I would say pretty close to a real-life scenario.
